# Dotify
### Homework 2
### Matthew McVicker

##### This is a low functioning "music player" named Dotify that can alert users if they've skipped or went back on a track, change the number of plays, and change the username. I have added a songlist which can allow users to select songs and click to toolbar at the bottom to view the songplayer with their selected song.

##### Still need to fix comments from HW1

##### EC Animate Shuffle
